# Clean-Code-Z

Let me give you a short summary of who I am. 

My name is Chris and I'm a 4th year math and stats student that likes to do a bunch of random and dumb things with code.

Mostly whenever I have a groud breaking project idea my code never properly works! Cause you know sometimes your code just hates you and wants to give you an error for absolutely no reason. Other times I just slap a bunch of for loops and Truth statements together and what do you know I just cured cancer.

When these rare times do occur though that is when I create an article or video to show off what I created so I can convince myself that this wasn't a complete waste of time.

Now there are a minority of those who read and watch my videos who want to see the code themselves. The only problem with that is my code is messier than a hoarders garage and at times I can't even understand it. 

Hence the reason you're reading this right now.

You see for those who do read and watch my videos I'm really grateful and I do want to give back in a form of an exclusive content.

Clean-Code-Z is a group that I have offically created, and by being a member you get access to the code that I use in my articles and videos completely free. Now I'm not very creative so with the words Clean-Code in the title you probably know where I'm going with this.





This is the location where I post my code that I use in all my articles and videos. 


Now that you're now an exclusive member of Clean-Code-Z you get access to all my code completely free.

Even further I wanted to make sure members weren't confused when they saw the code.


So what I do for each piece of code I post is that I thoroughly clean the code and comment exactly what each line does...


Which is why the I called it Clean-Code-Z (The Z is just cause my last name is Zita)


So I hope you guys enjoy being apart of this group, and I'll be sending messages out whenever a piece of mine come out.
