# Clean-Code-Z

Welcome to Clean-Code-Z

This is the location where I post my code that I use in all my articles and videos. 

Now that you're now an exclusive member of Clean-Code-Z you get access to all my code completely free.

Even further I wanted to make sure members weren't confused when they saw the code.

So what I do for each piece of code I post is that I thoroughly clean the code and comment exactly what each line does...

Which is why the I called it Clean-Code-Z (The Z is just cause my last name is Zita)

So I hope you guys enjoy being apart of this group, and I'll be sending messages out whenever a piece of mine come out.
